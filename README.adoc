A CLI to pass the https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/asciidoc-lang/asciidoc-tck[AsciiDoc TCK]

== Build

 $ go build

== Usage

In order to run Libasciidoc against the AsciiDoc TCK, you will need to build the AsciiDoc TCK from the source to produce an executable.

NOTE: In the future, prebuilt binaries of `asciidoc-tck` will be available.

. Clone https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/asciidoc-lang/asciidoc-tck
. Make sure you have Node 18 installed
. Install the dependencies using `npm i`
. Build the project using `npm run build`
. Create an executable for your OS using `npx pkg -t macos .`. This command will build an executable for macOS. Other {url-pkg-targets}[targets] are available.
. If all went well, you should have an executable in the `dist` repository.

Now, we have all we need to pass the TCK! Let's run it:

 $ ASCIIDOC_TCK_ADAPTER=/path/to/libasciidoc-tck /path/to/asciidoc-tck
